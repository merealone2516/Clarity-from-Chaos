# CodeBERTScore Implementation Guide

## Introduction
`CodeBERTScore` is a Python script that utilizes the `CodeBERT` model from Microsoft to compute similarity scores between two paragraphs of text. This tool can be particularly useful for evaluating the semantic similarity of text in software documentation, code comments, and other technical documents.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Python and PyTorch installed on your system. You will also need the `transformers` library by Hugging Face to load and utilize the CodeBERT model.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using your preferred method. If you're unfamiliar with how to clone a repository, GitHub provides excellent documentation.

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Navigate to the directory containing the script and install the necessary Python libraries. If you are using a virtual environment, activate it before installing the libraries:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```
###Step 3: Run the Script

### Conclusion

This guide should help you set up and use the CodeBERTScore script for comparing text similarity. For more detailed uses or modifications, you can explore the transformers library documentation or adjust the script according to your needs.

Participant 1,"The AI summaries are a good starting point, but they lack the practical insights that come from human experience in software development."
Participant 2,"The AI system shows promise in handling more complex tasks, but I'm not entirely convinced about its full scalability yet. It is impressive, but there is a room for growth and adaptation."
Participant 3,"Integrating AI into our workflow could be a game-changer, provided it is implemented thoughtfully and complements human expertise rather than trying to replace it."
Participant 4,"While the idea of working alongside AI is intriguing, I have reservations about its reliability and effectiveness in practice. It could be beneficial, but I am uncertain about how dependable such a partnership would be in the dynamic environment of software development."
Participant 5,The summaries sometimes miss the detailed discussions that are important for understanding the issue. We still need to read through the threads ourselves.
Participant 6,"I find the summaries useful for quick updates, but sometimes they leave out important discussions from the comments. This could make us miss key points."
Participant 7,I feel the sumaaries are good and it does saves time but i can not trust them completely. For a verification i read the entire issue thread again. This trust i think will come witht time only.
Participant 8,"The AI needs more training to understand our specific terms and language. Right now, itâ€™s not fully capturing the essence of our discussions and decisions."
Participant 9,"I am more curious about, can these LLMs tell the root cause for the issue and potential solutions also?"
Participant 10,I like how the AI quickly sums up the main points from the discussions.
